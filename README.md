The ESP32-CAM is a full-featured microcontroller that also has an integrated video camera and microSD card socket.  It’s inexpensive and easy to use, and is perfect for IoT devices requiring a camera with advanced functions like image tracking and recognition.

The ESP32-CAM board has no USB port, so you can’t just connect it up to your computer and start loading programs.Instead you will need to add an external FTDI adapter.

Read the Wiki page for instructions on how to setup your circuit. 

Note: The ESP32-CAM only works with 2.4 GHz WiFi networks. My WiFi is 5GHz. That is why the page is not loading in the video. Everything else is working fine.
