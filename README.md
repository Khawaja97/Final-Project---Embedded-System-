The ESP32-CAM is a full-featured microcontroller that also has an integrated video camera and microSD card socket.  It’s inexpensive and easy to use, and is perfect for IoT devices requiring a camera with advanced functions like image tracking and recognition.

The ESP32-CAM board has no USB port, so you can’t just connect it up to your computer and start loading programs.Instead you will need to add an external FTDI adapter.
